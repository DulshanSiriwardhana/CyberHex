# CyberHex — C++ Machine Learning Engine + Real-Time Visualization

> **Project Status: Actively Under Development**
>
> This repository represents the **current state of an ongoing project**.  
> Features, structure, and performance are continuously evolving.

---

CyberHex is a **high-performance C++ machine learning framework** built from scratch, featuring:

- Custom matrix engine (no STL vectors)
- Dynamic multi-layer neural networks
- Forward & backward propagation
- Real-time training visualization via WebSockets
- React-based live dashboard

This project explores **low-level ML engineering + system design**, similar to a lightweight **TensorFlow + TensorBoard (C++ native)**.

# Current Features

## 🔹 Core ML Engine
- Custom `Matrix` implementation (`double**`)
- Dense (Fully Connected) layers
- Activation layers:
  - ReLU
  - Sigmoid
  - Softmax (in progress)
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation (manual gradients)

---

## 🔹 Neural Network System
- Dynamic layer stacking
- Multi-layer deep networks
- Modular `Layer` abstraction

---

## 🔹 Training Pipeline
- MSE loss (currently used)
- Epoch-based training
- Best model tracking
- Optional loss logging (CSV)

---

## 🔹 Real-Time Visualization (Experimental)
- Native C++ WebSocket server
- Live training data streaming
- React + TypeScript frontend

---
